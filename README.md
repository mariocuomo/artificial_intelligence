# Artificial Intelligence

This Repository is dedicated to different test and artificial intelligence algorithms inspired by the Artificial Intelligence course at Roma Tre University.

## Uninformed Search Algorithms
These algorithms don't have any information about the problem and for this reason they are often the least efficient.
Currently implemented:
- [x] Breadth First Search
