# Artificial Intelligence

This Repository is dedicated to different test and artificial intelligence algorithms inspired by the Artificial Intelligence course at Roma Tre University.
<br>The project is an App Console(.NET Core) developed using C#.

## Uninformed Search Algorithms
These algorithms don't have any information about the problem and for this reason they are often the least efficient.
Currently implemented:
- [x] Breadth First Search
