This Repository is dedicated to different test and Artificial Intelligence algorithms inspired by the Artificial Intelligence course at Roma Tre University.
<br>The project is an App Console(.NET Core) developed using C#.

## Search Path With Cost 
I'm in <b>Milan - MI -</b> and I want to go to <b>Naples - NA</b>.<br>
I have a map of Italy that represents the operators and their costs associated: the map indicates which cities are directly connected, together the relative cost of travel.

## Uninformed Search Algorithms
These algorithms don't have any information about the problem and for this reason they are often the least efficient.<br>
Currently implemented:
- [x] Breadth First Search
- [x] Depth First Search
- [x] Limited Depth First Search
- [x] Iterative Limited Depth First Search
- [x] Uniform Cost Search

## Heuristic Search Algorithm
Heuristic search is a form of search that exploits knowledge about a problem to find solutions more efficiently.<br>
Currently implemented:
- [x] Greedy Search
- [x] A* search


## Tic Tac Toe Game
Using MinMax algorithm to suggest the best choice in the tic-tac-toe game at each step.<br>
The algorithm is for perfect decisions, i.e. all possible combinations are expanded

## Python Test
This folder is dedicated to different Python test.<br>
Currently it contains files not related to programming for Artificial Intelligence.
