# Artificial Intelligence

This Repository is dedicated to different test and artificial intelligence algorithms inspired by the Artificial Intelligence course at Roma Tre University.
<br>The project is an App Console(.NET Core) developed using C#.

## Toy Problem
I'm in <b>Milan</b> and I want to go to <b>Naples</b>.<br>
I have a map of Italy that represents the operators and their costs associated: the map indicates which cities are directly connected, together the relative cost of travel.


## Uninformed Search Algorithms
These algorithms don't have any information about the problem and for this reason they are often the least efficient.<br>
Currently implemented:
- [x] Breadth First Search
